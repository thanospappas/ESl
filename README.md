##Abstract
Online social networks often show relationships with complex structures, such as close friends, political and sports rivals. As a result, each person is differently influenced by their friends and enemies. With this in mind, our goal for this project is to extract a signed network from a discussion forum (Reddit) based on the pair-wise interactions of the users, and examine whether or not the stability properties hold. Moreover, we try to predict the sign of the edges based on different techniques on Reddit as well as on Epinions, Slashdot and Wikipedia. We also examine on what degree our datasets generalize between them. The models for the three online social networks provided some interesting information on edge sign prediction, but for Reddit's dataset the results were inconclusive due to the lack of ground truth and poor structural balance.
